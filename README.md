# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to HTML elements, even with seemingly correct usage and configuration. The issue is resolved by ensuring that the Tailwind directives are correctly included in the HTML file and the build process, and that the correct styles are imported and applied. The `bug.html` file shows the initial problem, and `solution.html` demonstrates the corrected implementation.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` and `solution.html` in your browser.  Observe the differences in styling.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file shows a common scenario where a developer might expect Tailwind classes to work but finds that they don't render any styles. This is often due to a simple setup mistake or misunderstanding in how Tailwind processes CSS.
