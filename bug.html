I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  The HTML structure seemed fine, and the classes were correctly included in my CSS file, but the styles simply wouldn't apply.  I checked and double-checked my class names for typos and ensured that the Tailwind configuration file was set up correctly, but the problem persisted.
