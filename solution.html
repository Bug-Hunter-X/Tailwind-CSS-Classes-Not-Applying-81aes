The problem was solved by ensuring that the correct directives are included to enable Tailwind within the HTML. In the corrected `solution.html` file, the `<script>` tag that initializes Tailwind must be present and correctly placed within the HTML file.  Also, ensure that your CSS file is properly linked and that your build process (if using one) handles Tailwind's compilation correctly.  Double-check your Tailwind configuration file to ensure it correctly points to the CSS file and that it is being processed by your build system.
